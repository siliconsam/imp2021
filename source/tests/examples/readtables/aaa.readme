For Windows:
analysetables.bat <table>

For Linux
./analysetables <table>

The folder contains include files for the imp parser for 3 machines:

arm
i77
vax

To generate the lex,par debug files generated by takeon from a grammar file

e.g. from the i77.tables.inc, then <table> = i77 so as to run

analysetables i77

This will:
1) copy the required include file to tables.inc
2) compile readtables.imp with tables.inc as an include file
3) generate lex.<table>.lis and par.<table>.lis

NB. For the 3 example include files the declaration of the kdict array
must be changed from:
%constshortintegerarray kdict(32:618)

to be an %own array.

%ownshortintegerarray kdict(32:618)

This is to allow the code to determine the array bounds of kdict to be found by the routines

    %integer min kdict = array lower bound( kdict, 1)
    %integer max kdict = array upper bound( kdict, 1)

The routines array XXX bound( <name>, <index> ) require <name> to be a non-constant variable.
